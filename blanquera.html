                Aspiring Nicholasian writers can share their pieces with us to participate. We will feature a "LITERARY PIECE OF THE MONTH" on our platform. This project welcomes both english and filipino writers. My goal is to provide a space for the literary community of Nicholasians to express their creativity and talent.

                I believe that by highlighting exceptional writing, I think we can motivate and inspire people to pursue their own creative potential by showcasing outstanding writing.</p>

                <br><br>
                A collaboration with school administration to establish a designated distribution center/room for sanitary pads on campus.
