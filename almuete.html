            <h2>• Be who you are</h2>
            <p>I wholeheartedly embrace the DepEd memorandum regarding the stringent enforcement of the Gender-Responsive Basic Education Policy. We firmly uphold the principle that every student, irrespective of their sexual orientation, gender identity, or race, deserves access to a secure and nurturing educational setting. Our unwavering commitment lies in cultivating an environment where all students are embraced, respected, and empowered to express themselves freely, shielded from any form of prejudice or bias.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>• Environmental Conservation</h2>
            <p>Waste segregation in a classroom involves sorting different types of waste into separate bins or containers based on their categories, such as recyclables, non-recyclables, organic waste, and hazardous materials. Each bin should be clearly labeled to ensure proper disposal. This practice promotes environmental sustainability, reduces the amount of waste sent to landfills, and teaches students about the importance of responsible waste management. Additionally, it fosters a sense of responsibility and environmental awareness among students, encouraging them to adopt eco-friendly habits both inside and outside the classroom. This should be implement in every classroom.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>• Kalyeserbisyo</h2>
            <p>This initiative aims to provide essential assistance to students and individuals in need, both within and outside the school. I firmly believe that true leadership entails more than just fulfilling responsibilities within the school environment but also extending that support to individuals and communities outside the school.</p>
