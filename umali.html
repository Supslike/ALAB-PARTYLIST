            <p>In this project, a room designated for students' concerns will be open to the learners inside SHS in San Nicholas III, Bacoor City. The office will contain different tables for specific concerns and each table will be handled by the SSLG Officers. The sample tables will be:</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>• Free Printing Desk</h2>
            <p>A lot of students are going to faculty rooms to ask if they can print out academic materials that are needed at the moment because due to security reasons, the guard wouldn't allow them to go outside the campus. Building this free printing desk will be a great help to a lot of students. The funds for this project can come from SSLG-conducted programs and donation drives.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>• Gender and Development Concern Desk</h2>
            <p>All the desks will be checked regularly (every week) in able to maintain their efficiency and make sure that the concerns will not just rot inside the students' desks. The concerns about any type of discrimination towards any learner will be addressed by the SSLG Officers, with the guidance of their SSLG Adviser.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h2>• Anti-Bullying Taskforce Desk</h2>
            <p>This office's goal is to make sure that the smallest concerns of the students will be handled well without directing them to the Guidance Office, so the said department's burden will be lessened and they could focus more on bigger and major issues of the school. It is a proposal aid to lift the small business out of the bigger table.</p>
